# The goal of this program is to get the basic information from an encrypted text. This only works for this encrypted text in the vigenere_cipher file: 
    # This does not solve the encryption, however it gives all the tools required to solve it. Which I completed the rest manually. 
    # Some of the code was taken from my other decryption program I wrote for the caesar cipher. 
    # It can be modified to work with any encrypted vigenere cipher text in the future.
